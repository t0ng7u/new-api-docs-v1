title: Xinference Rerank Format
---

<Callout type="warn" title="Important Note">
  In New API, Xinference's rerank response structure will be formatted as Jina's rerank response structure, and its usage will be the same as Jina's rerank. **For client users like Dify**: When configuring, please select **Jina AI** as the provider type instead of Xinference, and use Xinference-supported model names.
</Callout>

## 📝 Introduction

Xinference's rerank API is fully compatible with Jina AI's rerank API. Please refer to the [Jina AI Rerank Format](jinaai-rerank.md) documentation for detailed usage, request parameters, and response format.

## 💡 Usage

When using the Xinference rerank API, simply set the `model` parameter to a Xinference-supported rerank model; the remaining parameters and usage are the same as the Jina AI rerank API.
